Hello and welcome to Slap Bot!

Slap Bot is a fun little project designed to do the thing that 
you would love to do to just about anyone on the internet, but 
can't due to distance constraints.

Slap Bot can be used as:
	A moderation tool
	A meme

Slap Bot features great commands such as 
	!slap @User to give the user a good ol' smack
	!topslaps to see a leaderboard of the top slapees
	!ping because I followed a bot tutorial

In order to configure and run your very own slap bot, do the
following:

	Register your copy of Slap Bot to the Discord Developer Portal and add it to your server
	Fill out required fields in the config.json file
	In cmd, navigate to your copy's source folder and type node --inspect index.js
		(This requires you to have node.js installed on your pc!)
	That's it!

Want to customize your Slap Bot? Slap Bot is very easy to
customize to your server's needs. In the config file, there
is an array of gif links where the various gifs that Slap Bot
uses are hosted. Add and remove links to customize your copy
to your liking!

Thank you for your interest in Slap Bot! If you like it, feel
free to share it with all your friends!
